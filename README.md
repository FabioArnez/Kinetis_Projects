# Embedded Systems Course Repository
# Universidad Privada Boliviana - Electronics and Telecommunications Eng.

This repository is intended to provide examples for NXP Kinetis Developments Boards to students of the Embedded Systems course.

The major part of the examples uses Kientis Design Studio (KDS) with Processors Expert (PEx)Tool, therefore the projects include only the source code files in order to avoid problems with file extensions from PEx.
